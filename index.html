        <h1>Declaration of Independance</h1>

        <p>
            When in the Course of human events, <strong>it becomes necessary</strong> for one <b>people to dissolve</b>
            the
            political bands which
            have <i>connected</i> them with <em>another,</em> and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate
            and
            equal
            station to
            which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind
            requires
            that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.
        </p>

        <h2>Problems with the King</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.</li>
            <li>He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in
                their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to
                attend to them.</li>
            <li>He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those
                people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and
                formidable to tyrants only.</li>
            <li>He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the
                depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his
                measures.</li>
        </ul>
